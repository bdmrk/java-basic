*** Java 8 we got something very very new in java => Functional Programming.
*** Functional Programming is not new for programming world but for java .
***it was in Scala, Haskell in fact in C#.
***it was there in all the language that work in cloud.

Four important feature in Java 8 .
1. we can define method in interface
2. Functional Programming
3. Lambda Expression
4. Stream Api

***oop there from 80's. 80's to till now the main thing is object. but now the main things is not object. its function
*** instead of focusing on object , now we focus on the behavior of object

*** functional programming, lambda expression and stream API
1 define methods other than declare methods
2 functional programming:
i) imperative programming-> focus on what to it and how to do it
ii) declarative programming -> focus on what to do it
3 lambda expression
4 stream API: achieve concurrency
