collection -> A Concept
Collection -> Interface
Collections -> Class


***ArrayList is a Collections which Implement Collection Indirectly
ArrayList implements List
List implements Collection
***ArrayList->List->Collection
Array is Faster than Collection
if Size is fixed go for Array and not fixed go for Collection

*** Collection doesn't work with index number;
*** List Works with index number . List can have duplicate value
*** Set doesn't have duplicate value. Every Element of Set will be unique (HashSet(), TreeSet())
*** Advantage of TreeSet() gives sorted data

()-> function
{} -> method definition
[] -> array
<> -> generic (Type) . generic is supported from 1.7 and above


====================Map============
Map<key ,value>
*** Map is also an interface
Map<Integer , String> map = new HashMap<>();
